Are you looking to discover an IBM i/AS400 midrange system? [Click here for the IBM i/AS400 docs page](ibm-i-as400.mdx).
:::

Device42 can discover IBM mainframes running the z/OS operating system, and like most discovery jobs, z/OS discovery can be scheduled to run automatically.

## IBM z/OS Discovery Job Prerequisites and Information

- **License requirement**: IBM z/OS discovery requires a license.
- **Compatibility**: IBM z/OS discovery works for almost all z/OS systems.
- **Discovered details**: IBM z/OS discovery jobs currently find: 
  - Device names
  - IP addresses (both v4/v6)
  - Machine information (serials, capacities, manufacturers, device names)
  - OS versions
  - Hardware (CEC units)
  - Services attached to service ports
- **FTP configuration**: Discovery happens via FTP on port 21. FTP **must** be enabled and connections accepted for an IBM z/OS discovery to succeed.

    Our FTP discovery expects to use the default IBM translation tables — if you encounter an issue with this, please [contact Device42 Support](https://support.device42.com/).

- **Netstat communication**: Device42 requires access to the TSO `NETSTAT CONN` command.
- **Permission**: Collecting disk information requires access to the `STGADMIN.IDC.DCOLLECT` profile.
- **Security** No special security rights are required. A standard TSO logon is sufficient.

Discovery is a non-intrusive process, as no files are created on the z/OS system and no software is installed on the z/OS system.

One discovery job must be created **per job card**. If multiple instances share the same job card (as configured), they can be discovered in the same job, but this is often not the case.

## IBM z/OS Discovery Updates

Device42 has enhanced IBM z/OS discovery with additional capabilities and device results.

- **Processor information**: The number of IBM z Integrated Information Processors (zIIPs) and IBM z Application Assistance Processors (zAAPs) are recorded as components on the device record.
- **Disk space details**: The number of drives, their capacity, and their space used (in TB) are captured as mount points on the device. Note: Access to the `STGADMIN.IDC.DCOLLECT` profile is required to collect disk information.
- **User and connection data**: Information on current TSO users, TN3270 connections, and GCP processor capacity in MIPS is added in the form of extra fields on the device record.
- **Database and queue managers**: The data of executing DB Managers for DB2 and IMS/IBM MQ Managers is captured as **Services**.

## Create an IBM z/OS Mainframe Discovery Job

Navigate to **Discovery > HyperVisors / \*nix / Windows** and click **+  Add Hypervisors/\*nix/win for Autodiscovery** to create a new discovery job. Select **IBM z/OS** for the **Platform**. Add only one discovery job per IBM z/OS **Job Card**.

## IBM z/OS Discovery Options Explained

**Job Name:** Enter a unique name to identify the IBM z/OS autodiscovery job.  
**Remote Collector:** Optionally, specify a remote collector from which to run discovery, instead of from the main appliance.  
**Job Debug level**: Turn debug on or off.  
**Platform:** Select “IBM z/OS” for mainframe discovery.  
**Discovery Target(s):** Specify the FQDN or IP address of the IBM z/OS target you want to discover. If using FQDN, ensure Device42 is set up to resolve DNS. Configure the DNS settings in your Device42 virtual machine (VM) console under option **1**.  
**Port:** Only change this if your admin has configured a custom listening port. IBM z/OS discovery uses FTP port 21 by default.
**Discovery Target(s) Credential(s):** Specify a username with permissions on your z/OS mainframe. Usernames are not case sensitive on z/OS.  
**ADM Sampling:** Specify the application dependency mapping (ADM) data collection interval.  
**Discover Using FTPS**: Use FTPS for the discovery job.  
**Job Card:** Input the job card specific to this discovery job. You may need to contact your administrator to get this information. One job card is required per job and a new z/OS discovery job must be created for each additional job card.  
**Alternate zOS TCP Command:** Enter a parameter you can use to specify the TCP command used in discovery.  
**Autodiscovery Schedule:** Optionally, you can set z/OS discovery jobs to automatically run according to a schedule.
**Job Status:** View or enter the status of the last discovery or task run.  
**Exclusions:** Input any addresses/FQDNs to exclude from this discovery job.  
**Naming Options**: Set a device name, as given in the server field of the job, and add non-authoritative aliases.  
**Host Discovery**: Select options for the host OS name, serial number, and UUID; specify the action to take if no VM is found; and select an object category for discovered devices.  
**Software and Applications**: Select options to discover software and services.  
**Miscellaneous**: Select the service level, the service customer, the device VRF group, and tags.

For information on other jobs that can be run via this screen, see the dedicated [Linux / Unix Discovery Docs page](/auto-discovery/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery.mdx). 

## Run Now or Schedule

Select **Add another Auto Discovery Schedule** when editing the job to create a run schedule for the job.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/z-os-ibm-mainframe/z-os-schedule-dark.png'),
  }}
/> 

Select **Run Now** from the list page under **Discovery > HyperVisors / \*nix / Windows** to run the job immediately.

<ThemedImage

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/z-os-ibm-mainframe/run-z-os-now-dark.png'),
  }}
/> 

Newly created jobs will not run on the first day they are created, to prevent an unintentionally large amount of jobs from running initially. If you would like to run a job after its initial creation, select the **Run Now** button next to the job after creation.
