## Intune Autodiscovery

[Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) is a cloud-based service that focuses onÂ mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). An organization can control how its devices (including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops) are used and configure specific policies to control applications.

Intune autodiscovery identifies mobile devices and mobile application software managed by Intune.

## Intune Discovery Job Configuration

Before starting the autodiscovery job, ensure that you have an active Intune license.

You also need to make sure you have the application permissions required for a Device42 autodiscovery job. Navigate to the Azure portal and [grant admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent) for the following application permissions:

    - `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All`
    - `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
    - `User.Read.All`

### Create a New Intune Discovery Job

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/intune-autodiscovery/add-intune-job-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/intune-autodiscovery/add-intune-job-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Select **Intune** from the cloud autodiscovery **Type:** dropdown menu.

Enter a **Name** and **URL** (for example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/[tenant domain or ID]`) for the discovery job.

Open the Azure portal and register an application on the same tenant as Intune:

- Give the application a **Name** in the **Branding & properties** section.
- Add the **Client ID and Secret** in the **Certificates & secrets** section.
- [Grant admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent) for **API Permissions**.

Copy the application **Client ID** and **Secret** from Azure and enter them in the Device42 discovery job fields:

- Paste the Azure **Client ID** in the discovery job **Client ID** field.
- Paste the Azure **Secret** value in the discovery job **Client Credential** field.

### Configuration Options

Optionally, you can also:

- Select or add a **VRF Group** for the discovered items.
- Select a **Remote Collector** to use for the job.
- Choose to **Overwrite existing device hostname with discovered hostname**.
- Select **Strip Domain Name** to remove the domain name (everything after the first period) from the discovered name.
- Set an **Object category for discovered devices** to assign a specific category to discovered devices.
- Set a job **Service Level** (for example, "Development", "Deployment", or "Production") to apply to the discovered items. See [Service Level and Object Category Options](index.mdx#service-level-and-object-category-options) for details.
- Enter comma-separated **Tags for discovered devices**.
- Select or add a specific **Customer for discovered devices**.
- Set the **Debug level** for the job.
- Choose to **Discover Software** to detect managed software applications.
- Set the **Initial Software Type** for discovered software.
- Set the category of **Intune Device Ownership** to discover "All", "Corporate", or "Personal" devices.
- Enter **Notes** for the job.
- Set the Intune discovery job to run on a regular schedule.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/intune-autodiscovery/schedule-job-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Click **Save** to save the Intune discovery job.

### Intune OS Names

Intune OS data has lower precedence than data from more authoritative sources, like OS-level discovery. For example, the Device42 agent will pick up "Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise" more quickly than the generic Intune name "Windows". The lower precedence ensures more detailed OS names are collected, enhancing the data-filtering capability of the agent.

### Renaming Intune Devices

Devices within Intune are renamed during the build process. If a device name is not updated as expected following Device42 autodiscovery, or after being renamed and updated in Intune, select the **Overwrite existing device hostname with discovered hostname** option.
