Device42 supports [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/) autodiscovery from v19.02 of the Main Appliance. Run a Jamf cloud autodiscovery job to bring in data about your Apple ecosystem.

## Jamf Autodiscovery Items

Currently, Jamf autodiscovery retrieves data on the following:

- Computers
- Mobile devices
- IP and MAC addresses
- Installed software and applications
- Extension attributes (Custom Fields)

## Requirements for Jamf autodiscovery

To run a Jamf autodiscovery job, you need to set the appropriate permissions in your Jamf account and provide your username and password on the Device42 autodiscovery job.

### Permission Requirements

A standard Jamf user account with read-all permissions is required for autodiscovery. The easiest way to grant read-all permissions is to create a standard user account with the **Auditor** privilege set. 

Alternatively, you can use a **Custom** privilege set with all-read permissions enabled. 

For information on standard accounts and privilege sets, see the [Jamf User Accounts and Groups](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Jamf_Pro_User_Accounts_and_Groups.html) official documentation.

### Authentication Requirements 

Your Jamf account username and password are required in the **Basic credentials** field when creating a discovery job.  

Your username and password are first used to request a bearer token. Bearer token authentication is then used for subsequent requests.

## Create a Jamf Autodiscovery Job
