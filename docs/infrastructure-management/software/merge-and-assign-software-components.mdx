### Merge Software Components and Assign Them to a Suite

You can merge software components and assign them to a component suite.

- Select **Resources > Software Components > All Software Components** to display the Software Component list page.
- Select the components you want to merge, select **Assign Software to Suite** from the **Select an action** dropdown menu and click the hammer icon to run the action.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-assign-software-components/merge-assign-software-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Click **Select Software Suite** and search for an existing software component to create the suite and assign the selected components. After you select or add the suite component, click **Assign** to confirm.

  }}
/>

### View Assigned Components in a Suite

To view the assigned software components in the suite, select the suite name from the Software Components list page. The assigned software components are listed in the **Software Components in this Suite** box.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-assign-software-components//software-components-in-suite-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Merging Software Components with the Same Name

To merge software components that have the same name into a suite, merge them together before merging them into a suite. A new component suite cannot have the same name and vendor combination as an existing software component; it must have a unique name and vendor combination.

For example:

- software component ABC with vendor Cisco (**ex. 1**)
- software component ABC with vendor MS (**ex. 2**)
- software component ABC-Suite with vendor None (**ex. 3**)

You can merge ex. 1 into ex. 3, or merge ex. 2 into ex. 3, with no problem â€“ however, trying to merge ex. 1 AND ex. 2 into ex. 3 will result in a validation error, prompting you to merge ex. 1 with ex. 2 before trying to merge them with ex. 3.
