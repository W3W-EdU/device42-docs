### Merge and Assign Software Components to a Suite

You can merge software components and assign them to a component suite as follows.

- Navigate to **Resources > Software Components > All Software Components** to view the **Software Components** list page.
- Select the components you want to merge, choose **Assign Software to Suite** from the **Select an Action** dropdown, and click the **hammer icon** to run the action.

      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-assign-software-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Device42 displays the **Assign Software to Suite** page listing the software components you selected.

      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-selected-components-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Click **Select Software Suite** to choose an existing software component from which to create the suite (that the selected components will be assigned to) or click **Add Software Component** to create a new component for the suite.

      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-add-component-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Once you've added or selected the suite component, click **Assign**.

- Device42 then opens the **View Software Component** page and displays the new component suite. The assigned software components are listed in the **Software Components in the Suite** section.

### Merging Software Components with the Same Name

To merge software components with the same name into a suite, you must first merge them together before merging them into a suite. A new component suite cannot have the same **name + vendor** combination as an existing software component; it must have a unique **name + vendor** combination.

For example, if you had:

1. Software component `ABC`, with vendor `Cisco`
2. Software component `ABC` with vendor `MS`
3. Software component `ABC-Suite` with vendor `None`

You could merge either `1.` **or** `2.` into `3.` without problem. However, if you tried to merge `1.` **and** `2.` into `3.`, you would receive a validation error prompting you to merge `1.` with `2.` before trying to merge them into `3.`.
