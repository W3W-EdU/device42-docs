The Device42 Software License Management (SLM) module enables the easy creation and management of software licensing models by automatically scanning Windows and Linux machine instances for software; whether running or not. The SLM module can compare counts of running instances against purchased or licensed counts and detect prohibited software without any need for agents. There is absolutely no need to install software agents on each machine that you require monitoring on!

## Discovering Software Components

When creating or editing a discovery job under **Discovery > Hypervisors / \*nix / Windows**, you will see the following autodiscovery form:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add discovery job"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/add-discovery-job-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/add-discovery-job-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Scroll down to the **Software and Applications** section. By default, **Discover Software** is enabled to facilitate the autodiscovery of software on Windows and Linux machines in the defined CIDR blocks, Hostname, Domain servers, or IP range(s) provided.

<ThemedImage
  alt="The Discover Software option"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-and-applications-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-and-applications-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

All major Linux distributions are supported, and software registered across various package managers will be discovered.

### View Discovered Software

To view the full list of discovered software, navigate to to **Resources > Software Components > All Software Components**. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="All Software Components menu location"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-components-menu-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-components-menu-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }} 
/>

As with other list views in Device42, you can sort the discovered software components using the column headers, the various **Advanced** filters on the right side of the page, the **search box** at the top of the page, or the bulk actions in the **Select an action** dropdown.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Software component list page"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-component-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-component-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Bulk Actions

On the **All Software Components** list page, you can make bulk modifications to specific software components:

- Use the checkbox to the left of each instance to choose records from the list.
- **Select an action** from the dropdown.
- Click the **hammer icon** to execute the action.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Software component bulk actions"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-actions-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-actions-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

The available actions are:

- **Delete with Detailed Confirmation**
- **Fast Background Delete**
- **Export selected items**
- **Assign Software to Suite**
- **Refresh/update Software counts**
- **Refresh/update OS counts**
- **Mark selected Software as Managed**
- **Mark selected Software as Prohibited**
- **Mark selected Software as Ignored**
- **Mark selected Software as Unmanaged**

For example, you could select several software components and choose to:

- **Mark selected Software as Ignored** and Device42 would remove the components from the list and ignore them in future discoveries.
- **Mark selected Software as Prohibited** and Device42 would send alerts whenever prohibited software was found on a user's machine (if the alert was configured).
_ **Refresh/update Software counts** and the software counts (but not the autodiscovery job) would be run immediately. 

The **Refresh/update Software counts** action is useful when you have changed the licensing or software count configuration and want to see the impact of the change immediately.

#### Assign Software to Suite

The **Assign Software to Suite** action is also useful, as it allows you to group selected software components into sets. 

For example, if you wanted to group Adobe products, you would create a suite and then assign Adobe software components to it.

- To create the suite, you could either select an existing software component and define it as a suite orcreate a new software component using the **Add Software Component** button and call it something like "Adobe Software Suite".
- Then, you could select Adobe software components from the list, choose **Assign Software to Suite** from the **Select an action** dropdown, and click the **hammer icon** to assign them.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Assign software to suite"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/assign-software-to-suite-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/assign-software-to-suite-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Change Software Component

Click on the name of a software component and then select **Edit** to add additional details to its record. For example, you can specify a **License Model**, select a **Vendor**, add and define categories, and add **Notes** and **Tags**.

Check the **Track Licensed Count by Keys** checkbox to have the software usage count be based on keys, rather than the total number of instances of the software component.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change software component"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-1-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-1-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You can also add **Software Component Aliases**, add **License Keys**, view the actual instances of the software found by the discovery process under **Software In Use**, and add **Purchase/Support Info**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change software component"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-2-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-2-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change software component"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-3-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-3-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Software In Use List Page

Navigate to **Resources > Software In Use** to see the individual instances found for each software component. In this view, you can filter by the name of the software component, the device, or the user and sort the results by device or user.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Software In Use list page"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-3-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-3-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Software License Models

The flexible Device42 license models enables you to track any type of licensing you use. Navigate to **Resources > Software License Models** and click **+ Add Software Licensing Model**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add Software License Model"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/add-software-licensing-model-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/add-software-licensing-model-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }} 
/>

The **Track By** field enables you to specify whether the licenses should be tracked by **User**, **Device**, **Client Access** (CALs), or **Device CPU/Core**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Track By dropdown"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

### Tracking By User

If you choose to track by **User**, you will see the options:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Track By User"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-user-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-user-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

The **License Type** field lets you specify whether this is a **Perpetual** license or a **Subscription**. This is just a documentation field and doesn’t affect how Device42 counts the instances it finds of the software components.

The **Count Users by** field enables you to specify the purchase method. This is also just a documentation field and doesn’t affect how Device42 counts the instances it finds of the software components.

The checkbox options do the following when enabled:

- **Is Node Locked:** Specifies that each licensed instance of the software is restricted to a specific device.
- **Is User Locked:** Specifies that each licensed instance of the software is restricted to a specific user.
- **Is free:** Indicates free software.
- **Is Concurrent Access:** Specifies licensing is by the concurrent user and not by the total number of users that have access to the system.
- **Count Major Version Separately:** Specifies each major version of the software should be counted separately.

### Tracking By CALs

If you choose to track by **Client Access** licenses, you will see the options below and that the options are the same as those for tracking by user, except for the addition of the **Count CAL by** field.

The **Count CAL by** field specifies how the licenses should be counted; that is, counted on a **Per Seat - Device** basis, **Per Seat - User** basis, or on a per **Server**, **Processor**, or **Mailbox** basis.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Count CAL"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/count-cal-by-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/count-cal-by-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

### Tracking By Device

With the **Device** track by option, you see the **Count Devices by** field. This field is used solely for documentation and has five options: 
- **Volume**
- **Volume with a multiplier**
- **Single**
- **Unlimited**
- **OEM**

<ThemedImage
  alt="Track By User"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/device-count-by-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/device-count-by-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

### Tracking By Device CPU

If you choose **Device CPU/Core** track by option, you will see four additional fields:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Track By Device CPU/Core option"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-device-cpu-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-device-cpu-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '45%' }} 
/>

The **Count Devices by** field has five choices as listed above.

The **CPU core factor field** is for the core factor rating used by some software manufacturers.

The **CPU Count** field defines how CPUs are counted: **Total sockets** or **Total # of cores**.

The **CPU count virtual** field defines how software found on virtual machines is counted:
- **Total # of cores on host** 
- **Total sockets on host**
- **Total # of cores on VM**
- **Total sockets on VM**
