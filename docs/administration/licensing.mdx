## Introduction

Device42 licensing provides a Core license for autodiscovery and offers additional license modules for additional discovery and data retrieval capabilities.

- The Core license includes discovery of physical, virtual, and cloud components, IT inventory and asset management, all out-of-the box integrations, RESTful APIs and webhooks, warranty and SSL certificate management, cable management, password management, and IP address management.

Device42 licensing is based on license units, with the units consumed at different rates by different discovered resources. For example:

- 1 Device = 1 License Unit (1 : 1)
- 10 Containers = 1 License Unit (10 : 1)
- 50 TB Storage = 1 License Unit (50 TB : 1)
- 10 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) = 1 License Unit (10 : 1)
- 10 Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) = 1 License Unit (10 : 1)
- 100 Archived Records = 1 License Unit (100 : 1)
